DECAF NOTES: 

WHERE YOU LEFT OFF ***
Fixed the login routing system, but might be able to make it more simple
*** Added "host left game" feature, but the message quickly blips before 
returning to default story page.  

TODO:
- Password security *** Also for login password, shouldn't be in the script
    make::Hash

- Eventually add a delete confirm message (for admin)
- Make story private option (not saved)
- WRITE UNIT TESTS & add more robust error messages
- ADD FORM report bugs to my gmail
^^^ Designed, now just need to add functionality -- send to gmail
    Currently submit button crashes site cause no csrf
- Add notifs to home
- Redesign story default page

WHEN DECAF GOES LIVE 
- Gather stats on which page users are at the most, then reorganize if statements 
    to reflect this

Can I make different web routes for POST on the same page? Just for better organization

NOTE: Added a procedure!
NOTE: !isset($data["leave"]["user"]) checks whether or not user hit the leave button, 
    because other leave is passed regardless, but ["leave"]["user"] only submits when 
    hitting the button
NOTE: Writing collab mode! Authors can see the entire story and 
    write as much as they want; whenever they're done, they end their 
    turn and pass it onto the next person / "Writer's Circle" 
    *** Also should be a way to download story as .txt file
NOTE: Create error messages for missing fields
NOTE: Start game screen (for host) will need dynamic loading, too
    (to see all the players joining)
NOTE: left bar will be a button grid wall that randomly spawns different 
puzzles, like correctly putting together a poem or something. 
Only a 10% chance of seeing the puzzle, otherwise a carbonation gif. 
NOTE: Wall of Shame. (Your parents would be disappointed.)
        Wall of Sham. (This story is a ripoff of another story.)
        Wall of Fowl Language. (You're a gizard, Harry!)

REMEMBER if you create a fake game from phpMyAdmin, make a fake story too
or you won't be able to join anything!

ADMIN CONTROLS can be accessed by logging into a PRIVATE GAME 
(this game also stores all previous games)

SPEND A DAY writing error messages -- because they ARE NECESSARY! Your code 
WILL BREAK




PHPUNIT TESTS! YOU NEED TO MAKE THEM! QUINN! DO IT! PLEASE!
- overflow for game info (make really long room keys and passwords, usernames, etc)
- SQL injection for join form and story text



phpMyAdmin quick commands 

Create new game and story: 

INSERT INTO GAME (GAME_KEY, GAME_PASS)
VALUES ("DELETEME", "123"); 
SELECT @id := GAME_ID FROM GAME ORDER BY GAME_ID DESC LIMIT 1; 
INSERT INTO PLAYER (GAME_ID, PLAY_USER, PLAY_SESSION) 
VALUES (@id, "Mr. Host", "session1"); 
UPDATE GAME SET GAME_HOST = "Mr. Host", GAME_SESSION = "session1" WHERE GAME_ID = @id; 
INSERT INTO STORY (GAME_ID, STORY_TITLE, STORY_TEXT)
VALUES (@id, "Delete me pls", "Starter text"); 

Set turns: 

SET @count := 0;
UPDATE PLAYER SET PLAY_TURN = @count := @count + 1
WHERE GAME_ID = ? ORDER BY RAND();
UPDATE GAME SET GAME_RUN = 1 WHERE GAME_ID = ?; 

Set game back to GAME_RUN = 0: 

UPDATE GAME SET GAME_TURN = 1, GAME_RUN = 0 WHERE GAME_ID = ?;




GIF IDEAS: 
- carbonation bubbles rising upward, light blue drink, fizzy (inner content side banner)

SPLASH IDEAS: 
- I put the hippo in Hippocratic Oath

CHARACTER CREATION: 
- Everyone writes a name
- FakeCharacter (FC) gets passed to random people
- Everyone gives their FC one physical trait
- Swap FCs 
- Everyone gives FC one positive quality
- Swap FCs
- Everyone gives FC one negative quality 
(etc)
- Random category is assigned, then everyone has to vote which FC would win the category
- Game Master mode where someone writes all the prompts


RNG GAME: 
It requires about as much technical skill as winning at UNO.
