DECAF NOTES: 

NOTE: Added a procedure!

FOR STORY GAME
- while loop that acts as event listener; checks players joined, 
- checks if turn has been completed, will STOP running if USER's turn 
- and once game begins (no more extra players joining)

RULES should be in the join page, and then under rules are recent stories
    or something of the like

IF YOU LEAVE GAME, $_SESSION game stats need to be destroyed

checks if begin is true or false (stored in SQL) once host begins, 0 -> 1
if begin, check if your turn (also needs to be stored in GAME)
    Make a specific subset of GAME (inherits attributes) for story
while !begin || turn 
    

- PASSWORD PROBLEM! GET shows the password in url. To solve this, 
    encrypt the passcode
    ALSO use POST instead, because pass will still show otherwise

- Players joining screen can have a stupid little GIF running
- Host can decide when to start the game

- Players are given turn # based on random int generated 0 - (num of players)

- STORY_TEXT needs to have a default value of "" (can chars be appended?)

SELECT SUBSTRING_INDEX(
    (SELECT STORY_TEXT FROM STORY), 
    " ", 
    -1
); 
    
SELECT LENGTH(STORY_TEXT) - LENGTH(REPLACE(STORY_TEXT, ' ', '')) + 1 FROM STORY;
(^^^ Store this in a variable, pass it to the procedure)

GIF IDEAS: 
- carbonation bubbles rising upward, light blue drink, fizzy (inner content side banner)
