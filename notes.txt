DECAF NOTES: 

WHERE YOU LEFT OFF ***
Failing to address public resources, will need to reconfig path
Need to install laravel on vm I think, site is breaking

EVENTUALLY fix the double loading thing :(
Replaced storyComplete with a session variable, need to test if it works
    did this because polling reload erases the finished story screen (for players)
    NEED to make the screen for if player submits turn but game is done
Fixed the login routing system, but might be able to make it more simple

TODO:
- Add read more to home page stories
- WRITE UNIT TESTS & add more robust error messages
- ADD FORM report bugs to my gmail
^^^ Designed, now just need to add functionality -- send to gmail
    Currently submit button crashes site cause no csrf
    Prevented crashing, but still no worky

- Improve if statements in story.php by UserController sending code and comparing with switch statement instead (for future)
- Eventually make functions for repeating code (especially "collecting stories")
- Eventually add a delete confirm message (for admin)
- Make story private option (not saved)
- Have try catch instead of another query to check room key validity (UserController 250)
- Make new controller for password management

RESEARCH whether or not malicious users can edit $_SESSION. 
I DON'T CARE whether or not they can SEE it, just editing. 
(Actually maybe seeing would be bad if password returns unencrypted.)

- Add notifs to admin 
- Maybe for player login, save query info for key until new key is used
    (Why? Because then multiple attempts for one key uses less db power. 
    Locks after certain amount of failed attempts.)

WHEN DECAF GOES LIVE 
- Gather stats on which page users are at the most, then reorganize if statements 
    to reflect this

Can I make different web routes for POST on the same page? Just for better organization

NOTE: Added a procedure!
NOTE: !isset($data["leave"]["user"]) checks whether or not user hit the leave button, 
    because other leave is passed regardless, but ["leave"]["user"] only submits when 
    hitting the button
NOTE: Writing collab mode! Authors can see the entire story and 
    write as much as they want; whenever they're done, they end their 
    turn and pass it onto the next person / "Writer's Circle" 
    *** Also should be a way to download story as .txt file
NOTE: left bar will be a button grid wall that randomly spawns different 
puzzles, like correctly putting together a poem or something. 
Only a 10% chance of seeing the puzzle, otherwise a carbonation gif. 
NOTE: Wall of Shame. (Your parents would be disappointed.)
        Wall of Sham. (This story is a ripoff of another story.)
        Wall of Fowl Language. (You're a gizard, Harry!)

REMEMBER if you create a fake game from phpMyAdmin, make a fake story too
or you won't be able to join anything!

ADMIN CONTROLS can be accessed by logging into a PRIVATE GAME 
(this game also stores all previous games)

SPEND A DAY writing error messages -- because they ARE NECESSARY! Your code 
WILL BREAK




PHPUNIT TESTS! YOU NEED TO MAKE THEM! QUINN! DO IT! PLEASE!
- overflow for game info (make really long room keys and passwords, usernames, etc)
- SQL injection for join form and story text
- Create with no password, create with no key



phpMyAdmin quick commands 

Create new game and story: 

INSERT INTO GAME (GAME_KEY, GAME_PASS)
VALUES ("DELETEME", "123"); 
SELECT @id := GAME_ID FROM GAME ORDER BY GAME_ID DESC LIMIT 1; 
INSERT INTO PLAYER (GAME_ID, PLAY_USER, PLAY_SESSION) 
VALUES (@id, "Mr. Host", "session1"); 
UPDATE GAME SET GAME_HOST = "Mr. Host", GAME_SESSION = "session1" WHERE GAME_ID = @id; 
INSERT INTO STORY (GAME_ID, STORY_TITLE, STORY_TEXT)
VALUES (@id, "Delete me pls", "Starter text"); 

Set turns: 

SET @count := 0;
UPDATE PLAYER SET PLAY_TURN = @count := @count + 1
WHERE GAME_ID = ? ORDER BY RAND();
UPDATE GAME SET GAME_RUN = 1 WHERE GAME_ID = ?; 

Set game back to GAME_RUN = 0: 

UPDATE GAME SET GAME_TURN = 1, GAME_RUN = 0 WHERE GAME_ID = ?;


What to write in my about page: 



GIF IDEAS: 
- carbonation bubbles rising upward, light blue drink, fizzy (inner content side banner)

SPLASH IDEAS: 
- I put the hippo in Hippocratic Oath


PICTIONARY-ISH GAME: 
- Host writes prompt, other players draw prompt
- Host guesses who's is who's 
- Most points wins

CHARACTER CREATION: 
- Everyone writes a name
- FakeCharacter (FC) gets passed to random people
- Everyone gives their FC one physical trait
- Swap FCs 
- Everyone gives FC one positive quality
- Swap FCs
- Everyone gives FC one negative quality 
(etc)
- Random category is assigned, then everyone has to vote which FC would win the category
- Game Master mode where someone writes all the prompts
- NOTE: Winner only wrote the name so that would not be fair? Think about


RNG GAME: 
It requires about as much technical skill as winning at UNO. 

- "Someone is calling your phone" 
    :Answer it
        1. Oh no, you answered a spam call and now they know this number is active!
            (-5 internet safety, +5 curiosity) 
        2. Mr. Beast says you just won a spot on his newest video: "100 People Outlast 1 Man-Eating Tiger!"
            (+5 curiosity, +10 fame)
    :Ignore it
        1. 

- NOTE: Negative points kill you?
